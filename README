gcal-ticker uses perl to parse your calendar from Google CL.  It displays text 
updates for as long as it stays running.  The idea is to pipe it into an xmobar
or dzen and have an agenda line displayed on your screen.

Requirements:
    Google CL           (0.9.13+  /  svn 543 or newer)
    gdata-python        (2.0.12+ should work, but I'm only testing on 2.0.14)
    perl
    perl DateTime       (libdatetime-perl)
    perl AppConfig      (libappconfig-perl)
    perl Tie:IxHashA    (libtie-ixhash-perl)
Recommended
    dzen2 or xmobar

ticker.pl can be called directly.  use -help, -h, or -? for command line options.

ticker.sh is just a wrapper script to pipe output into dzen or wherever.  You will have to
customize its path and probably customize its dzen options.

All command line options can be specified in a .gcalticker file.  This is recommended.
An example dotgcalticker file is included.

TODO:
- Error handling.  Google occasionally gives an AttributeError and Internal Server Error
  In both cases, calendar should probably download again instead of going blank.

- ^ca() clickable areas.  Maybe a popup for each event.  ^ca would require dzen2, 
  so no more xmobar support.  Not available in current dzen2, so not worthwhile yet.  
  Also depends on what additional info google publishes.

- Background/font changes.  We're using background colors for active events.  Where
  else can they go without being garish.  Also dzen2 only.

- Configurable output.  Templates?  Awesome, but not high priority.
