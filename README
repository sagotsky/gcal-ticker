gcal-ticker

gcal-ticker uses perl to parse your calendar from Google CL.  It displays text 
updates for as long as it stays running.  The idea is to pipe it into an xmobar
or dzen and have an agenda line displayed on your screen.

Requirements:
    Google CL           (svn 543 or newer)
    gdata-python        (2.0.12+ should work, but I'm only testing on 2.0.14)
    perl
    perl DateTime       (libdatetime-perl)
    perl AppConfig      (libappconfig-perl)
    perl Tie:IxHashA    (libtie-ixhash-perl)
Recommended
    dzen2 or xmobar

ticker.pl can be called directly.  use -help, -h, or -? for command line options.

ticker.sh is just a wrapper script to pipe output into dzen or wherever.  You will have to
customize its path and probably customize its dzen options.

All command line options can be specified in a .gcalticker file.  This is recommended.
An example dotgcalticker file is included.

TODO:
    fix perl lib definitions to find gtEvent.pm
    event in progress sticky (maybe indicate with color and a new flag?  prepend time with a symbol?)
    notify-send alerts (optional)
    output templates (eventually)
